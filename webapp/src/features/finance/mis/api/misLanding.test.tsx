// Finance no longer HAS overview cards. Its landing forwards to the first item
// the reader can open (`forwardsToFirstItem`, PerspectiveLanding), so the one
// thing MIS can still put on the Finance landing is itself, as the place the
// landing sends you. What an overview card used to leak — "there is company ARR
// behind this" — the landing now leaks by opening ARR Build. So this renders the
// REAL landing over the REAL visibility hook and the REAL MIS gate, and mocks
// only the HTTP answers underneath, as misRail.test.tsx does for the rail.
//
// PerspectiveLanding.test.tsx cannot cover this: it stubs the visibility hook
// whole, so no MIS gate is ever asked there.
