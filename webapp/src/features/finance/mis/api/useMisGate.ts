// ARR Build, QRR, MRR and ARR Analysis on a single ARR_DASHBOARD number
// (Config.js:56), so this is a set rather than useMarketingOpsGate's per-item
// ITEM_CAPABILITY map: a map whose every value is the same number says nothing.
//
// Named rather than read off MIS_APPS, and that is the point (spec §10.13): an
// entry joining the registry without a line here is HIDDEN, not opened to 987.
// Everything else fails closed too — MIS has no unrestricted screen, so unlike
// the sibling gates there is no open default for an unknown id to fall into.
// useMisGate.test.tsx turns red on a registry entry left out, which is the cue
// to decide who it is for and add it.
//
// ARR Analysis needs a second condition on top, and it is not a privilege —
// see ANALYSIS_ITEM_ID below.
/**
 * The one screen whose existence is a server-side decision as well as an
 * authorization one: `productsUsageEnabled` from `GET /app-configs`.
 *
 * The flag is folded in HERE rather than asked beside `canSee` at each call
 * site, and that is load-bearing. `SideRail` and `MisShell` both decide what to
 * show by asking this gate, so a separately-consulted flag is one either could
 * forget — and forgetting it fails OPEN, publishing a screen the backend has
 * turned off. One question, one answer, both conditions inside it.
 *
 * The route asks `useMisAppConfigs` for the flag directly as well, because it
 * needs something this boolean cannot carry: whether a `false` is the backend's
 * answer or merely the absence of one. See MisArrAnalysisPage.
