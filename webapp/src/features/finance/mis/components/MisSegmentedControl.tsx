// The shape the MIS Build screens' Table-level controls share: Region Type,
// the Region Summary's View, and the customer table's Breakdown. Each of them
// chooses between two arrangements of a table the reader is already looking at,
// none of them is in the URL, and all three
// were the same twenty lines with different words in them.
//
// It stays a presentational control and holds no state: what the choices mean,
// which is the default, and what a change does to its siblings are the caller's
// questions, and they differ at each of the three call sites.
//
// PROTOTYPE (branch prototype/mis-look): in the faithful variants (A, C) this
// renders the source's `.region-summary-controls` — an uppercase 12px/700 label
// beside the same segments the Period row uses; B keeps Oxygen's toggle group.
